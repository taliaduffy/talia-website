The early 2000s was the last time Champaign-Urbana residents remember their home as a major location for live music. Local and national acts alike drew significant crowds, reveling in the culture, the energy and the experience of this central Illinois college town. Now, when an act plays in the area, it’s called “getting Champaigned.” 

The very name of the town has become a curse.

For reasons and a period of time that span far beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, live music in Champaign-Urbana has been declining –– and some members of the community aren’t sure if its salvation is possible.

“There’s acts that have played here where they should draw really well, and then they don’t,” Jeff Brandt said, referring to a recent performance by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. “And then you know that band’s never coming back after.” 

Brandt was raised in Champaign and is heavily involved in the town’s local music culture, so he has witnessed this transformation firsthand. Exile on Main Street, his record store in downtown Champaign, used to hold regular live music events. Their most notable guests include Ride, a 90s shoegaze band of international fame, and Chris Robinson from The Black Crowes. However, Exile’s famous “record stage” hasn’t heard a note in years.

“We used to have live music at least once a month. And we plan to again, but it’s still just –– it’s not quite necessarily worth it yet,” Brandt said.

He’s not the only one that misses the old days. Kati Turk is the Director of Special Events for Jay Goldberg Arts and Entertainment, a live music powerhouse that operates several music festivals and owns 11 venues in central and southern Illinois alone. 

Two of these venues are among Champaign-Urbana’s most famous: NOLA’s Rock Bar and the Canopy Club, both located in Urbana.

Turk has been involved with the Canopy Club since she was a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2002.

“It was awesome… It was a great time for live music,” Turk said of her college years. “We had Piano Man, which was like, on a Tuesday night, you could come in and get two dollar long islands and you could listen to this amazing man play the piano. He played Britney Spears, Billy Joel style.”

Turk remembers when shows by local bands at the Canopy Club seemed like campus-wide events. Bands would promote a few songs on local radio, prompting students to buy the complete CD –– “at that point, there wasn’t iTunes” –– and get to know their music better.

“There’s just a ton of bands that came through at that particular time just as they were getting ready to jump into, you know, the real mainstream,” Turk said. “And so you look at the calendar and you’d be like, Oh, I think I’ve heard of them.

“So it kind of made it a little more fun to actually go to the shows. But yeah, it was packed.”

If you ask Brandt about audiences in Champaign-Urbana today, he probably wouldn’t use the word “packed.” 

When Thurston Moore of 1980s rock band Sonic Youth played at the Accord in Spring 2016, Brandt remembers that the crowd consisted of “twenty to twenty-five people.” In his opinion, the turnout would have been much different only 10 to 15 years earlier.

“[Champaign has] gotten kind of notorious, I think, for small crowds,” he said.

As a result, national acts have played fewer and fewer shows in Champaign over the years. The town went from hosting music legends like Simon and Garfunkel, Elvis Presley and Fleetwood Mac in the 1960s and 1970s to mid-level acts like Young the Giant, Portugal. the Man and Miranda Lambert in the 2010s. 

Many of these acts were drawn to the area by Star Course, a student-run organization at the University. The organization hosts and organizes concerts and festivals for students and the community. 

Brandt believes that Star Course has the potential to revitalize live music in Champaign, but is failing to meet the challenge. 

He strongly criticized their outreach to the greater Champaign-Urbana population. On February 5th of this year, Star Course hosted a concert with Canadian rapper Bbno$ in Foellinger Auditorium. Weeks later, Brandt wasn’t aware the event had occurred at all. 

“They’re the worst,” he said. “Star Course is notorious for not, like–– I mean, we [the community] don’t get a lot of fliers for stuff in general like we used to, but like, they never [promote things].”

Star Course did not respond to several requests for an interview about their club and its operations. 

While Star Course organizes concerts with less and less popular artists over the years, they are not solely responsible for live music’s decline in Champaign-Urbana. So what else changed? 

Brandt believes that the closure of multiple music venues in the area has contributed to the issue. It’s a vicious cycle: venues close, so acts don’t have as many places to play –– but when acts don’t play, it’s harder for venues to stay afloat.

Many popular live music venues have closed in recent years. Once credited for kickstarting the revitalization of Champaign’s downtown area, the Blind Pig no longer hosts live music. 

“If I were to guess–– I’m not too sure what the city calls downtown or what the limits are, but we’re probably talking about less than five [venues that] have live music,” Xander Haxel, Executive Director at the Champaign Center Partnership.

He believes that there’s only so many venues the Champaign community can support before they crowd each other out –– as if the city has recently exceeded its carrying capacity for these types of businesses.

This graph, constructed using city data provided by Hazel, displays the amount of food and beverage restaurants in downtown Champaign per calendar year. No data was provided for calendar years 2013 and 2014.


A majority of music venues in the area double as food and beverage businesses, so these numbers can be assumed to reflect the general trend of music venues as well.

Since 2018, there has been a sharp decline in these types of businesses in the downtown district. This decline began two years before venues were forced to close, so while the trend was definitely worsened by the pandemic, it cannot be the sole cause. 

Like Brandt, Turk attributes this issue to something bigger.

“Unfortunately, we need the support of the local community to sell those tickets, and those people need to be buying tickets, and those bands need to be touring,” Turk said. “And so it’s definitely an ecosystem.”

In her position at the Canopy Club, Turk is responsible for finding acts to play at each of the venue’s three stages. She has noticed that filling up the spots has become increasingly difficult as more aspects of Urbana’s musical “ecosystem” started to fail.

It started with the radio, as she remembers it. 

“Something that happened a few years ago –– pre-pandemic –– was [that] radio really stopped playing rock music in our area,” Turk said. “And so it was really hard for us [not] to have that partner.” 

WPGU 107.1, the local student-run radio station, used to dedicate certain hours of their airtime to live performances from local, alternative-oriented bands. By advertising acts to the student community, those acts would draw larger audiences at their Canopy Club performances.

Turk said those programs faded away over time. According to WPGU program director Sidney Malone, the station still sprinkles local content into their playlists, but it no longer has its own time slot. 

WPGU’s general format shifted, too; instead of focusing on alternative music like it did in the 1990s and 2000s, the station began to delve into indie and other genres. Malone pins the station’s loss of focus to 2018, the year Illini Media moved from their Green Street office to the basement of the YMCA.

“Things start to get a little loosey-goosey,” Malone said. “I think the program director wasn’t taking it as seriously as they had been, and there was a little bit of less expectations for it.”

Thus, one aspect of the ecosystem weakened.

While Malone doesn’t think WPGU can be blamed for the decline of live music in Champaign-Urbana, he admits that the station has distanced itself from the community in recent years. As the new leader of the only alternative-format radio station in a 100 mile radius, his main goal is to return WPGU to what it once was.

“We’re making already some moves to get back in the community and working with artists and local music,” he said. “We’re getting back on format. We’re playing alternative music and only alternative music.”

Turk also laments the lower number of bands in town as a contributor to the scene’s decline. In her days as a student, punk, alternative and indie bands dominated the market. Now, most of the acts that are looking to play –– and that draw the largest audiences –– are DJs that play club-style EDM. 

“We don’t want to be just the place to go to see DJs, or the place to go for hip hop shows,” Turk said. “We also want to do country shows and rock shows and indie punk shows and all of that. And there’s just not really a ton of local people to kind of help us build that up at this moment.”

This is especially frustrating to the Canopy Club, which prides itself on having a show for everyone, no matter their music taste.

“Much like the canopy of the rainforest is the Earth’s most bio-diverse region, the Canopy Club is committed to diversity in the entertainment we provide for our patron base,” reads the information page on the company’s website.

Turk said the Canopy Club is working to find new talent, sometimes reaching out to acts from outside Champaign-Urbana to play at their venue. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has created further complications on the industry’s path towards recovery. For a period of time, bars and restaurants were able to open at a limited capacity while live music venues continued to suffer closures. This allowed music venues’ greatest competitors –– Campustown bars like Kams and Red Lion –– to assert a near monopoly on student entertainment.

“The freshmen come in, and they see all the lines on Green Street, and the Canopy Club is dark for 18 months,” Turk said. “It becomes an afterthought. You’re almost like, ‘Oh, that place is closed.’ [And] yeah, we were.”

But through it all, some people see an opportunity within the pandemic as restrictions loosen and cases continue to decline. 

In Turk’s eyes, there’s a “100%” chance that live music in Champaign-Urbana will one day return to its previous glory. Similar to its decline, she believes its revival will be a chain reaction.

“I think all it really takes is a few people to really kind of care,” she said. “If we can get more regional acts to come through, I think that’ll inspire more people that are local to actually join a garage band or come out to open mic and try out their stuff.”

When asked why she believes the Canopy Club survived this long, Turk had an immediate, simple answer.

“We have some really stubborn owners. We do,” Turk said. “They love the club, they love live music, and it runs in their blood. And they just refused to lose to the pandemic… and it was a hard fight.”

The hard fight likely isn’t over, but it’s possible that live music can win.
